Car Dealership Project
Car Sales system is an application that computerizes the conventional car sale procedure which we are aware of. This is a Java/Spring/HTML based application (NO REACT). This helps in managing data related to buyers and sellers of the cars. Business reports can also be generated and viewed.


This program should handle a new and used vehicles inventory with minimum 10 cars. Every detail of a vehicle like
manufacturer name,
date of purchase,
Kilometers run( in case of used vehicles),
price,
make/model,
car description
picture/s of the car etc.


If a user click to view details of a car we should display the car details :eg
name,
model,
year build,
price,
description,
picture, etc...


If a car is sitting in inventory for more than 120 days, there should be an option to place a bid on the car.
Bidding cars can be sold at a discounted price up to 10% if and only if the dealership's purchase date is over 120 days.


The inventory should have a minimum 3 cars with idle days of 120+.
The inventory should have an option to replenish the inventory by adding pictures and details of a car.


The application should have a reporting section which displays information about all transactions made, including the person who purchased the car.
This reporting page should order transactions by date starting with the most recent purchase.


A user should also be able to search for a type (model) car from the inventory.


The inventory should only have cars available to be sold. If a car has been sold
the inventory should reflect this behavior.


Note:
You are required to upload your project on github, then submit your github project url.


Bonus:
Add functionality to add a new car to the inventory including a display photo of the car.
Enable the application to store all sale transactions (save records in db).
